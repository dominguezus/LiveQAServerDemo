Whats happening is instead of shifting to second gear the rpm goes goes to like 4000rpm (I never let it go past that) then I let go of the petal to bring the rmps back down then press petal again and it shifts to second. All the other gears are good. Is this a transmission problem or maybe a solenoid? Can anyone help me? Thanks all.	Maintenance & Repairs	1461146019000
YA:20160420025439AAJw6G2	What evidence did this historian give for his belief that Hitler would not have been stopped prior to 1939?	In this excerpt, the author argues that the discussion about stopping Hitler prior to 1939 was not an issue, for several reasons. [N]either the people nor the government of [Britain and France] were conditioned to the idea of war .... Before September 1, 1939, Hitler had done nothing that any major power considered dangerous enough to warrant precipitating [starting] a major European war. Nor was there any existing coalition that could have opposed Hitler's massive forces. For Britain sought to appease Hitler [and] the French feared a repetition of the bloody sacrifices of 1914-1918. Stalin wanted an agreement with Hitler on partitioning Europe and the United States rejected all responsibility for Europe. Source: Keith Eubank, Origins of World War II, Thomas Y.

YA:20160420025539AAj7C0O	I need help please open.?	It's about to be 2 weeks this Saturday coming up that I went to my doctor to get a check up because I had some itching around my private area and it turned out that it was just a yeast infection and they gave me a pill and told me not to have sex for a week. I did as the doctor said and had no sex. Today my boyfriend was giving me oral and he noticed something that my fluids tasted "different" in other words I guess really sour ( nasty ) . My vagina doesn't smell and there's no itching, there's white discharge but that doesn't smell either. I've been diagnosed with BV in the past and I'm not getting those symptoms, also when I went to the doctor my vagina already had that "taste" and I'm pretty sure if I had a BV the doctor would've prescribed me two medications. What can I do about this? Should I see another doctor? Or does my diet maybe have something to do with this? I need suggestions please	Women's Health	1461146139000

First few tines I threw up something clear/yellowish, guessing that was bile? Then i took pepto 15min ago and just right now, i three up that and something brown guessing the beans. Anyways I'm still throwing up, probably threw up like 10 times already. I feel really weak, should I be drinking Gatorade while I'm still throwing up?

I want to start an apparel company, and I thought it would be nice to have a few pairs of glasses as part of the line up. Thing is, I was looking at a pair of wood glasses built around a wire frame. But I can't help but wonder if the reason I don't see people wearing wood glasses is because people don't want them. So tell me, what situation would you see yourself most likely wanting to buy a pair of wooden sunglasses in? What would you be willing to pay?	Fashion & Accessories	1461147904000
YA:20160420032612AA7z7KO	Do I need to see a doctor (sleeping problems)?	I've been known to be able to marginally function on 6-7 hours of sleep, but for the past few days I'll feel pretty tired once I get home around four and then end up asleep by 6 to 7. The problem is I find myself only able to sleep for three or four hours before waking up restlessly and (lately) drenched in sweat. This has been going on for about two weeks and its really starting to effect my ability to focus on school. The thing is we came back from spring break a week and a half ago (were my sleep sched was super weird because of no school), so should I wait it out a little more?
